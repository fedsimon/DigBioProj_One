auxiliary functions:
distance(a,b):
	compute distance between atoms a and b

angle(a,b,c):
	compute angle between atoms a,b,c

find all possible donors and all acceptors

for donor in donors:
	for acceptor in acceptors:
		determine sec_struct
		[acceptor,donor] = determineAccDon()
		compute distance(donor,acceptor)
		compute distance(hydrogen,acceptor)
		compute angle(donor,hydrogen,acceptor)
		compute angle(donor,acceptor,acceptor-ant)
		compute angle(hydrogen,acceptor,acceptor-ant)
		check if hydrogen bond:
			then save values for sec_struct

calculate means and std_devs
